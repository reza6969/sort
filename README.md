How the typescript compiler works !!

# tsc index.ts

How we can figure can configure our TypeScript Compiler to now work with these two seprate directories.
To Do So, we need to generate a file called a config Json File.
This is a TypeScript Compiler Configuration file that we can use to customize how the compiler behaves

# tsc --init

means watch all the files inside of the root dir or essentially the src directory

# tsc -w

we now have to acutally figure out how to run this thing
And thtat's going to run my javaScript Files

# node build/index.js

we still need to do a little bit of setup here and kind of automate the process of running our code every single time we make a change

so to do so, set up just a little bit of additional tooling to get started

# npm init -y

# npm install nodemon concurrently

back over to our terminal one more time. And then over here we can do npm start like so.

# npm start
